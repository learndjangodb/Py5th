# The next time you run your program, Python will load the .pyc files and skip the compilation step, as long as you havenâ€™t changed your source code since the byte code was last saved.

# That byte code is saved in files only for files that are imported, not for the top-level files of a program that are only run as scripts

# Python programs into true executables, known as frozen binaries in the Python world. These programs can be run without equiring a Python installation.
